Over 160,000 students in more than 190 countries enrolled, demanding a new way to deliver education. A startling discovery emerged: The top 400 students were not from Stanford. This revelation sparked a mission to make lifelong learning more equitable and inclusive. Support Skills has been expanding opportunities ever since.",
